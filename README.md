This is a website that features a local set of data that will be read upon load and render it within divs on the page using jQuery. Each div has a data-keyword value for sorting, a title, an image of the thing, and upon hovering over the image will display a short description. This site will default sort the data by keyword to display them. There is an option to view 2 seperate pages with different data. There is also the option to sort the page by number of horns. This project has dependecies on Handlebars version 4.0.12 and jQuery version 3.3.1.
